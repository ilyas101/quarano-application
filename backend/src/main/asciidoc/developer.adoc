[[modules]]
== Business modules

=== Overview
plantuml::{moduliths-docs}/components.uml[,,svg,title="Quarano component overview"]

[[modules.core]]
=== Core

Contains fundamental abstractions used from all other business modules:

* Base interfaces to demarcate Domain-Driven Design building blocks based on https://github.com/odrotbohm/jddd[jDDD].
* Fundamental domain abstractions like an email address or phone number.
* The `DataInitializer` abstraction to easily populate the application with demo data based on the abstractions provided by the individual modules.
* Common infrastructure support (auditing metadata, access to email templates, resource bundle based enum i18n etc).

[[modules.accounts]]
=== Accounts

Types to abstract parties interacting with the system: accounts that have roles assigned to them belonging to a department.
A thin layer on top of Spring Security to provide injectable access to the currently authenticated `Account`.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-account.adoc[]

[[modules.department]]
=== Department

Abstractions for a `TrackedCase` potentially related to a <<modules.tracking, `TrackedPerson`>>.
Also contains the abstraction of the <<modules.accounts, `Account`>> registration and parts of the enrollment process.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-department.adoc[]

[[modules.tracking]]
=== Tracking

Abstractions for the `TrackedPerson` associated with a `TrackedCase`, their ``Encounter``s with ``ContactPerson``s.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-tracking.adoc[]

[[modules.diary]]
=== Diary

Everything related to the medical diary a <<modules.tracking, `TrackedPerson`>> has to maintain.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-diary.adoc[]

=== Actions

Abstractions to capture anomalies detected in the life cycle of a <<modules.department, `TrackedCase`>>.
Can be either be related to the process of tracking (e.g. missing diary entries) or related to the medical situation of a <<modules.tracking, `TrackedPerson`>>.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-actions.adoc[]

=== Security

Implementation of JWT based security for the system, the expose of certain configuration properties related to that.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-security.adoc[]

=== Reference

Contains reference data like an abstraction of symptoms.

include::{moduliths-docs}/module-reference.adoc[]

== Technical structure

=== Implementing business logic

* Technical dependencies have to follow the structure declared and described in <<modules>>.
* Prefer dedicated state transitions on the aggregates and publish domain events via `registerEvent(…)`, especially if components upstream have to be notified.
* In thos upstream components, use ``@EventListener``s to trigger state transitions on other aggregates.

=== Implementing controllers

* Web components kept in separate `web` module sub-package
* JSON mapping via Jackson onto DTOs
* Mapping to domain types via `ModelMapper` API
** Spring Data integration to map UUIDs to domain identifiers and aggregates
** Use mapping customization to keep domain model strong. I.e. prefer those customizations over unenforced constraints in the domain model.
* Encapsulated in `…Representations` abstraction
** `….from(…)` methods to convert DTOs into domain types
** `….toRepresenation(…)` methods to convert domain types into DTOs
* Validation via JSR-330 and custom `validate(…)` methods on the DTO

==== Typical flow

1. Accept Jackson mapped payload
2. Use `MappedPayload` API to setup processing pipeline
3. Map incoming payload to domain types
4. Invoke domain services and repositories
5. Map results to DTOs

=== Documenting the REST API

* Use `@QuaranoWebIntegrationTest`, extend `AbstractDocumentation` and use the `MockMvc` instance provided by the superclass.
* In the request pipeline, call `andDo(…)` and create a `ResultHandler` and set up the aspects to document with that.
* Integrate the snippets generated as you see fit in any of the Asciidoctor API documents.
* Prefer reusing already existing tests. If none are suitable, create a separate one in `src/docs/java`.
* Equip DTOs with Javadoc and JSR-330 annotations if possible as that information will automatically make it into the auto-generated documentation snippets.

== Developing the backend

=== Code formatting

There's a code formatter for Eclipse available file://../../../../infrastructure/eclipse-code-formatter.xml[here].
Some additional settings that are not contained in the formatter:

==== Import order

* static imports, wild card used from the first declaration
* `*` - all unmatched imports
* `java.…`
* `javax.–`
* `org.…`
* `com.…`

==== Blank lines

Use blank lines to group pieces of code logically: variable initializations go together, followed by the method invocations that use those variables.
There's no hard rule here.
It's just nice to be able to identify different steps in the execution order.

For blocks (if clauses, methods) we start with a blank line if the subsequent code is longer than a single line:

[source, java]
----
void someLongMethod() {

  // First statement
  // Second statement
}

VS.

void someOneLineMethod() {
  // Single-line statement
}
----

Symmetric blocks usually also use a blank line on the end to clearly separate the blocks' content from the outer instruction.
Again, the single line rule applies, here, too.

[source, java]
----
if (…) {
  // Single line instruction
} else {
  // Single line instruction
}

but

if (…) {

  // Multi-line instruction
  // Multi-line instruction

} else {

  // Multi-line instruction
  // Multi-line instruction
}
----

The intermediate lines surrounding the `…} else {…` make it easier to see where the block flips.

In general, for if-else-clauses, prefer the ternary expression (`condition ? if-true : if-false`) over an if block.
That creates incentives to rather extract the statements to be executed in either and make the overall expression readable.
If the overall expression gets so long it would line break, it's nice to read if the three parts are each brought onto a single line:

[source, java]
----
Object someMethod(…) {

  return condition
    ? if-true-do-this
    : else-do-that;
}
----

==== Organizing methods

For a consistent discovery experience, a class is organized as follows:

1. `static final` fields in descending visibility (public ones first)
2. `private final` fields
3. `private` fields
4. Constructors in descending visibility
5. Static factory methods
6. Methods to be implemented due to interface declarations
7. Self-declared methods in descending visibility. Methods overridden from super types folded into the visibility group but last. E.g. `equals(…)`/`hashCode()` would follow self-declared `public` methods but precede self-declared package-private and private ones.
8. `private static` methods
9. Nested classes

Methods that do not use any of the class' fields should be declared static to make obvious that they're not related to the state of the class.
That's particularly helpful to potentially identify methods that could live on the parameter types instead or a dedicated value object assembling some of the parameters in case there's an abstraction implicitly hidden in the code.

In unit test classes, there's no need to qualify the fields used to keep the class under test or mocks with visibility modifiers as they don't make a practical difference anyway.
The class under test usually goes first followed by fields for mocks needed etc.

==== Lombok

The project uses Lombok to reduce the cognitive overhead of boilerplate accessor methods, constructors etc.
While this is convenient, make sure you always use the Lombok means that match what you intend to achieve precisely.
It might be tempting to just declare `@Data` on a domain class but just like blindly letting an IDE generate that code one time, that might generate just too much code with unintended side effects.
Also, always double check the visibility of the generated artifacts.
Setters should usually go package protected at best, factory methods should be preferred over public constructors etc.

==== Further IDE settings

The code base generally assumes Eclipse's Save Actions for organized imports and formatting to be applied.
